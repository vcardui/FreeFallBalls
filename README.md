# ðŸ¥ŽÂ Free Fall Balls

Simulation of free fall of two balls

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

Two bodies begin a free fall, starting from rest and at the same height, but with a time interval of 1 second apart. How long after the first body begins to fall will they be separated by a distance of 10 meters?

## ðŸ™Œ Project Personal Milestones

- Understood the relationship between time, the y component of the velocity vector

## ðŸ’¡ Inspiration for creating this project

This program was required as a homework for proving the accuracy of the problem mathematical solution provided at my Mechanics class. 

## ðŸ‘€ About the project

The program calculates the time at which the balls are at a distance of 10 meters between each other by calculating both ballâ€™s positions every 0.01 seconds, which was calculated by:

$V_{y} = V_{0y} - |g|t^2$

Where:

$V_{y}$: The y component of the velocity vector [$\frac{m}{s}$]

$V_{0y}$: The starting velocity of the y component [$\frac{m}{s}$]

$g$: Gravity = 9.81 [$\frac{m}{s^{2}}$]

$t$: Time [s]

$y = y_{0} + V_{0y}t - \frac{1}{2}|g|t^2$

Where:

$y$: The ballâ€™s current position [m]

$y_{0}$: The ballâ€™s starting position [m]

$V_{0y}$: The starting velocity of the y component [$\frac{m}{s}$

$t$: Time [s]

$g$: Gravity = 9.81 [$\frac{m}{s^{2}}$]
